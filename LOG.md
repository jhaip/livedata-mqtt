Converted ESP8266 code to run on Spark Photon.  The difference in processor speed was surprisingly large.  The ESP8266 runs at 80MHz and the Spark Photon runs at 120MHz.  This difference may be even more noticeable because the Spark Photon is using a better Wifi chip and can send the MQTT messages with a lot less delay.  This can be scene in the graphs as Photon plots are even and the ESP8266 plots have noticeable varience in the clock pulsing periods.  To deal with the Photon's speed every `digitalWriteMQTT()` had an added delay of 10ms.  Four extra `client.loop()`s where sprinkled in the loop as well, probably because the queue of MQTT messages to send grew too quickly or became too large.
